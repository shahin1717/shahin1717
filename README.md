### Hello there <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1645030248/53068/obi_wan.png?1645030248" width="25"> 
I’m [**Shahin**](https://linkedin.com/in/https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahin-alakparov-78832a274), a AI/ML engineer based in Azerbaijan.

I build intelligent systems, automate anything I can, and explore how mathematical thinking turns into real-world machine learning solutions.

My main stack includes *Python, PyTorch, FastAPI, and MySQL/Pandas* — but I’m just as comfortable diving into backend development, data engineering, or algorithmic problem-solving.

I enjoy creating clean, logical systems and understanding things *deeply*, not just following documentation.

```javascript
const shahin = {
  pronouns: "he" | "his",
  code: [Python, C, Java, HTML, CSS, JS],
  frameworks: [FastAPI, Flask],
  libs: [NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Ternserflow],
  databases: [MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL], 
  tools: [Linux, CI/CD, GITHUB, Docker]
}
```

#### Fun Facts:
- I prefer research-oriented ML work  🔭
- I love drinking coffee and herbal tea  
- I don't watch anime, but Attack on Titan is my fav anime
